> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/syllabus.html#academic-honesty). While my solutions are provided for each problem set, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any answers. There are many great communities for support and help, such as [CS50 Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/), the [CS50 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/) and the [CS50 Slack](http://cs50.edx.org/slack) to name a few. Investing your time and energy into solving each and every problem set indepdently is, in my opinion, the best way to experience the course and the only way to eventual mastery.
